# Yocto-Cross-Compile-SDK-CMake-Qt
Guidelines for building a Yocto cross-compile toolchain SDK that can be installed on a different host machine and how to configure QtCreator IDE for cross compiling to the target device using qmake or cmake. We had alot of problems lately in ORION project with configuring QtCreator &amp; CMake to build, deploy and debug in target machine.
